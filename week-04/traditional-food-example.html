    <h2>Pork roast, dumplings, and sauerkraut</h2>

    <p>
      Roast pork shoulder and sauerkraut with potato dumplings (Kopytka) are a
      comfort food lover's dream. While it might seem complicated making your
      own dumplings, I promise it's not. I first ran across this recipe when I
      was talking with my mother-in-law Dolores about her mother's plum
      dumplings. We were wondering if they were Czechoslovakian or Polish, and
      when searching for Polish dumplings this video popped up. My mom made
      these dumplings a few times but she typically made them on top of the
      chicken as a chicken and dumpling. I watched the video and thought I can
      make these dumplings and put them on top of a pork shoulder with
      sauerkraut, which is one of my favourite fall dishes.

      I started growing cabbage in my Ely Hilltop Garden specifically so I could
      make my own sauerkraut. I bought the cabbage plants at Ely Flower and Seed
      and started them in the ground right around Memorial Day. Other than
      watching for slugs (they love Cabbage) the growing process is pretty easy.
      I get 4 big heads (one on each plant) and if I cut them in July I can
      typically get a few smaller heads in late fall on the same plants.

      Her book is really fun and teaches you how to ferment all kinds of things
      like radishes, <strong>kimchee</strong>, zucchini, and cucumbers. I used a
      simple salt rub for my <em>sauerkraut</em> and added a teaspoon of red
      pepper flakes, as I like it a little hot.
