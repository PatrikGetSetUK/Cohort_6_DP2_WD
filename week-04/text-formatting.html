    <!-- HTML headings are defined with the "h1" to "h6" tags. Each important
      website should have "h1" tag due to SEO. -->
    <h1>Basic text formatting in HTML</h1>

    <h3>Text tags</h3>
    <!-- To create a comment in the code that only developer(s) can see simply
      text your comment, leave the cursor on the comment line(s) and press
      CTRL + / (on Windows). -->

    <p>
      To add a paragraph in your HTML code, you should use the "p" tag. This
      will display the text "This is a paragraph" in a separate block on your
      webpage.
    </p>

    <p>As default the paragraph is created on the new line.</p>

    <p>
      The text tags will automatically strip all extra spaces at the beginning,
      between, and at the end of the words/sentence. To adjust the text to our
      needs we will use CSS language later on.
    </p>

    <p>To add some extra spacing between HTML elements you can use "br" tag</p>

    <!-- Visual break between the lines. -->
    <br />
    <br />

    <p>
      As you can see some extra space between this a above paragraph was add.
    </p>

    <!-- Use HTML "span" tag for in-line text. -->
    <span>What about in-line text? Simply use "span" tag.</span>
    <span>
      It doesn't matter how many span you will place in the code bellow each
      other, they will always appear in-line nex to each other.
    </span>

    <p>
      Span can be used within a paragraph.
      <span>
        Like here. Remember that to use "p" tag inside the span is not
        convenient.
      </span>
    </p>

    <b>What about to make some text in bold?</b>
    <i>Or italic?</i>
    <span>
      As you can see bold and italic elements are in-line elements as well as
      span.
    </span>

    <p>
      Of corse you can use <b>bold text</b> or <i>italic text</i> inside the
      paragraph.
      <span>
        You can use <b>bold</b> and <i>italic</i> text within the "span" tag
        too.
      </span>
    </p>

    <!-- The text that has been deleted from a document. -->
    <del>
      The HTML "del" element defines text that has been deleted from a document.
      Browsers will usually strike a line through deleted text.
    </del>

    <!-- The text that has been inserted into a document. -->
    <ins>
      The HTML "ins" element defines a text that has been inserted into a
      document. Browsers will usually underline inserted text.
    </ins>

    <p>Use horizontal line, "hr" tag to visually divide web page.</p>

    <!-- Horizontal line. -->
    <hr />

    <h3>What about visual disability and the text in HTML?</h3>
    <p>
      Screen Reader apps for the people with visual disability will often
      require "strong" and "em" tags in order for the voice to stress those
      words properly.
    </p>

    <strong>
      The "strong" tag is used to define text with strong importance. The
      content inside is typically displayed in bold.
    </strong>

    <br />
    <br />

    <em>
      The "em" tag is used to define emphasized text. The content inside is
      typically displayed in italic.
    </em>

    <!-- Now its a time to create your second web page on your own. -->

    <h3>Links</h3>
    <h4>Bookmarks / Internal links</h4>

    <!-- The "a" link tag stands for Anchor.  -->
    <!-- The most important attribute of the "a" element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination. -->
    <a href="#page-top">Scroll Up</a>

    <br />

    <a href="#chapter-04">
      This is a bookmark / internal link to the Chapter 04
    </a>

    <h4>External links</h4>
    <a href="./second-page.html">
      Second Page - this is a link to another html document
    </a>
