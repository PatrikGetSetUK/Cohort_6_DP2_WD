    <h1>My favourite food is Pizza!</h1>

    <p>
      My favourite food is <strong>pizza</strong> because it is delicious, has
      many different toppings to choose from, and you can get it anytime. First
      of all, I think pizza is my favourite food because it is very tasty.
      <em>Pizza tastes good at any time of the day.</em> We've been eating pizza
      every Friday night for as long as I can remember.
